Title: National Vulnerability Database provides risk data.

Primary Actor: NIST Database

Goal in Context: The NIST database returns vulnerabilities in the code that carry risk

Stakeholders: Corporate Manager: Provides them with the risk and information to proceed with a project. Corporate Developer: Make changes based on the results of the risks.

Preconditions: You have to assume that code has a possibility of being inside the database.

Main Success Scenario: Corporate Manager and Developer carry no risk with the code within the project.

Failed End Conditions: Both the Corporate Manager and Developer have problems with the code and the risks are too great.

Trigger: The Corporate Developer sends code into the NIST database to be checked for risks.
