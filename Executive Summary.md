#Executive Summary

  As a company we are looking to bring in external source to reduce time and costs. Bringing in external source also brings in risk. We are going to need a system that can manage and process these risks. We will need a way for managers to evaluate risks against company policy. Currently there is no way for risks to be evaluated throught the NIST system.
  As a solution to the issue of risk, we are proposing this designed system. This system will allow managers to see what risks are associated with each external source. This system will also allow the NIST system to evaluate external source.
